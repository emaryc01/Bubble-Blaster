# Bubble-Blaster
Modifications to Bubble Blaster from DK 'Help your Kids with Computer Programming'
This is a modified and extended version of the 'Bubble Blaster' code from a book by DK

This is a great book for introducing children to Python but this program had a few problems, therefore the following changes have been made:
1.  Improved the structure to aid readability;
2.  Added comment documentation
3.  Used root window to get rid of an error message when window was closed via 'X' button

I have also added some extra functionality:
1. Changed bubble colours at random;
2. White bubbles are worth more points
3. Green bubbles lose 100 points
4. Theme music playing in background
